   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction PROJECT PARTITION of interzone surface BLOCK1:ZONE3_PARTITION_2_0_0 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction PROJECT PARTITION_REV of adjacent surface BLOCK1:ZONE1_PARTITION_4_0_10004
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 10 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 6 nominally unused constructions in input.
